If index of refraction : 1 for straght through, 2.42 for diamond like
Ra (ambient surface coefficient): 0 <= Ra <= 1
Rd (material diffuse coefficient): 0 <= Rd <= 1
Rs (material specular reflection coefficient): 0 <= Rs <= 1
f is a specular highlight coefficient: (f>=1) 
use -55 after your shape definition for your assistance

type: 1 | Plane
Only set 1 of the x,y,z normal. Position is where the plane will be located.
Ensure what ever norm is set, the corisponding pos is set. if x norm is set, only x pos is set
